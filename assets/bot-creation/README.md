![step 4](step4.png)  
5. Enable the Message Content Intent, click on "Save Changes" and click on "Reset Token" (here you can also change your bot's avatar and username, but that's not required for this tutorial)  
![step 5](step5.png)  
6. Press "Yes, do it!" (and type in your password if Discord feels like it)  
![step 6](step6.png)  
7. Click on "Copy" (note on tokens: you should never send/show your token to _**anyone**_, doing so will allow them to do **anything** with your bot)  
![step 7](step7.png)  
8. Go to Discord Squared's config and (1). change the false to true, (2). paste in your token here (note, the config may have changed between me writing this tutorial and you reading it, but the general format should've stayed the same)

9. Go back to Discord's website and click on OAuth2  
![step 9](step9.png)

12. Open the link as a new tab in your browser (or send it in Discord and click on it), select your server of choice (assuming you have created a server, if not, this is the time to do it) and click "Continue"  
![step 12](step12.png)  
13. Click on "Authorise"  
![step 13](step13.png)  
14. Go back to Discord and go to your Discord server, next, go to your Account Settings, go to "Advanced" and turn on "Developer Mode"  
![step 14 - 1](step14.png)  
![step 14 - 2](step14-2.png)  
15. Go back to your Discord server, right-click on the channel where you want your communication to happen and click on "Copy Channel ID"  
![step 15](step15.png)  
16. Go to Discord Squared's config and (1). paste in the channel id here  
![step 16](step16.png)  
17. You should be good to go! Be sure to check out the rest of Discord Squared's config  
18. Optional steps:  
- Go back to Discord's Developer Portal and in the "Bot" tab disable "Public Bot" (and click on "Save Changes"), this prevents anyone else from adding your bot to a different server  
- Change your bot's avatar and name to be something instead of Discord's autogenerated bs  
- Go to your chosen channel's settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks -> dscsquared_webhook and change the default avatar
